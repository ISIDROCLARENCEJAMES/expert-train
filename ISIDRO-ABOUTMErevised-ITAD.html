	<h1>Childhood Years</h1>
		<blockquote> <p> &nbsp; The way I lived my childhood is just one of the ways any ordinary child would have experienced and done it.<sup>1</sup> 
		Although, I do have to admit that there were was period of time in my childhood that made it not the best one to be in.<sup>2</sup>
		but, nevertheless, Iâ€™ll admit that it was one of the most fun parts of my life as any person would consider it. <sup>3</sup>
		I was enrolled in a Catholic school ever since Kindergarten, my mother herself is a very dedicated catholic herself. <sup>4</sup> 
		She has always taught me the prayers that would aid me in my everyday. <sup>5</sup> A part of my childhood that makes it a little different from others is that I never went outside to play.
		<sup>6</sup> I would always be alone at home to watch tv rather than going outside <sup>7</sup> 
		There was no particular reason why I did not go outside during those years, I did not mind too much <sup>8</sup>But I have a guess that my parents had something to do with it. 
		<sup>9</sup> Even when I try to go outside back then they would not let me <sup>10</sup>
		So for my childhood years, I did not know anyone around my area. <sup>11</sup> The only friends I were able to gain from were school, even there was not much of them.
		<sup>12</sup>Although I did not have many of them in my childhood years, my days as a child were still enjoyable because
		my friends were actually there to help me become happy <sup>13</sup> Some of my friends from school moved out early, but I still managed to make some new every year.
		<sup>14</sup> I enjoyed playing with them during my time in school, I knew I would not be able to play with anyone at home. <sup>15</sup> It was not too lonely for me to not be able to make friends around my neighborhood. 
		<sup>16</sup>Making friends back then were particularly easy in school. <sup>17</sup>I am not sure even if I did have friends around the neighborhood it would have made a big difference <sup>18</sup>
		As I grew up I started not to make any friends and ate alone during breaks. <sup>19</sup> But there were still some friends from back then who I could still talk to.

    <h1>Teenage Years</h1>
		<blockquote><p>&nbsp; When my teenage years started, there was not much to go into. <sup>1</sup> But all throughout it was enjoyable, a lot of things happened during those years. 
		<sup>2</sup> When I was in grade seven, I did not make a lot of friends in my class, but I managed to make some from other classes.<sup>3</sup> 
		whenever it was break time, I would go over to my friends from other sections and play with them and talk. <sup>4</sup> I was not close with my own class, because they were a little noisy. 
		<sup>5</sup> A lot of teachers did not like our class because of how noisy and chaotic my classmates can be
		<sup>6</sup> we also had a lot of changes for teachers because no one could handle our class peacefully. <sup>7</sup> during the next years of junior high school, I still would not make a lot of friends in my class. 
		<sup>8</sup> There were only those I could trust and comfortable with. <sup>9</sup> I did experience
		bullying back then, that would factor in why I did not make a lot of friends or why I am not particularly close with classmates. <sup>10</sup> 	In grade 10 I managed to make friends in my class, but not a lot. 
		<sup>11</sup> There were 3 friends in my class who I trust a lot, the taught me a lot of things.
		<sup>12</sup>Because of them I have learned to go out more often, the first time I played in computer cafes are because they invited me. <sup>13</sup>
		Back in senior high school I left my former junior high school to go to University of The East. <sup>14</sup> In grade 11 I only had a few friends, compared to my classmates in junior high, in my classmates in senior high were a lot more friendlier.
		<sup>15</sup> There was one particular person who I was close with in senior high. <sup>16</sup> I still kept in touch with my junior high school friends, we were always hanging out during our free time. 
		<sup>17</sup> In grade 12, I have met a great teacher who has taught me a lot of things. <sup>18</sup> He was one of the teachers who understood me the most,
		whenever I have problems I would always seek his advice on what should be done. <sup>19</sup> I would eventually graduate senior highschool at the age of 19, parting ways with my classmates.</p></blockquote>

	<h1>College Years</h1>
		<blockquote><p>&nbsp; My first year of college was a good experience for me, I finally know what to expect in college. <sup>1</sup> 
		The first few days, I have already made some friends, and until now they are my classmates. <sup>2</sup>
		The first semester in my first year was very busy, and it was a fun experience. <sup>3</sup> Most of my professors gave out tasks that could really help us in our future career. <sup>4</sup> 
		There were professors who would guide me thoroughly in the backbone of our course which is programming.
		t<sup>5</sup>In the first semester of our NSTP we were not able to go out too much due to rain <sup>6</sup>
		In the second semester, half of my classmates were from a different block, but good thing that the other half were my classmates from last semester <sup>7</sup>
		Our subjects during that semester were very interesting for me. My PE that time was Arnis, something I wanted to learn about too <sup>8</sup> 
		In January, Covid was first reported, I was honestly starting to get a little scared by that time already. <sup>9</sup>
		But it was not until March that it would affect everyone heavily. <sup>10</sup>
		When everyone was quarantined, it felt really sad for me, I was afraid and hoping that we could get our lives back from before. <sup>11</sup>
		During those days of quarantine, I have spent all of my days thinking about what could be next, and if there was a chance that the pandemic would end quickly 
		<sup>12</sup>Right now it does not seem possible, it will be a very long wait before everything could even return to it's previous state.
		<sup>13</sup> Then came online classes, where I enrolled together with some of my former classmates. <sup>14</sup>
		Everyone enrolled in online class are very lucky, everyone has a chance. <sup>15</sup> because there are a lot who were left behind in academics, due to the pandemic. <sup>16</sup>
		My experience of online class is okay, but my attention span sometimes cannot do me good. <sup>17</sup> 
		The way of learning in online class is very different from what I have been used to.  <sup>18</sup> Grasping every lesson can be a little easier due to recordings and it can help a lot if studying. 
		<sup>19</sup> As of now, I am hoping that the pandemic will end so we can no longer need online school. <sup>20</sup>
