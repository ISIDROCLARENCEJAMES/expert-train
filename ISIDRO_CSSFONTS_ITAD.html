		<blockquote><p style = "font-family:'yusei magic';">&nbsp;In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. <sup>1</sup> With the aid of "NerveGear" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts. <sup>2</sup>

Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito," is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game.<sup>3</sup> He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. <sup>4</sup> However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.
<sup>5</sup>

In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players.<sup>6</sup> Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game.<sup>7</sup> To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life.<sup>8</sup> Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.<sup>9</sup>

		<blockquote><p style="font-family:'yusei magic';">&nbsp; Considered a genius, high schooler Fuutarou Uesugi excels at studying and obtains a perfect score on every test. <sup>1</sup> Due to his intense focus on that regard, he is a reclusive person with no friends.<sup>2</sup>  Additionally, he lives in a tight financial state as a result of family debts. <sup>3</sup> 

Fuutarou's mundane lifestyle is interrupted when Itsuki Nakano, a new transfer student, contests him for his usual lunch seat.<sup>4</sup>  After a short altercation, Fuutarou emerges victorious by insulting Itsuki's eating habits, which angers her enough to leave.<sup>5</sup>  However, when Fuutarou learns that he has been offered the private tutor position of a wealthy family's academically hopeless daughters, he immediately regrets his prior encounter.<sup>6</sup>  It turns out that the beneficiaries of his tutoring are none other than Itsuki and her four identical siblings: the shy Miku, the cheerful Yotsuba, the devious Nino, and the mature Ichika!
<sup>7</sup> 
Teaching these quintuplets may prove more difficult for Fuutarou than he initially expected, as the last thing they want to do is seriously study.<sup>8</sup>  Now, Fuutarou must face the various challenges of tutoring five beautiful yet eccentric girls. <sup>9</sup>

		<blockquote><p style="font-family:'yusei magic';"> &nbsp; One year has passed since the Black Rebellion, a failed uprising against the Holy Britannian Empire led by the masked vigilante Zero, who is now missing. <sup>1</sup>At a loss without their revolutionary leader, Area 11's resistance group—the Black Knights—find themselves too powerless to combat the brutality inflicted upon the Elevens by Britannia, which has increased significantly in order to crush any hope of a future revolt. <sup>2</sup>

Lelouch Lamperouge, having lost all memory of his double life, is living peacefully alongside his friends as a high school student at Ashford Academy. <sup>3</sup> His former partner C.C., unable to accept this turn of events, takes it upon herself to remind him of his past purpose, hoping that the mastermind Zero will rise once again to finish what he started, in this thrilling conclusion to the series.
